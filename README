This package contains the GIZA++ toolkit and the mkcls tool, originally
written by F.J. Och and several other authors.

UPDATE 4th April 2015, 18th Nov 2025, by Hieu Hoang:

Works with most versions of gcc and clang, including really old versions.

Why not try using mgiza? It's multi-threaded and kept up to date to work with most compilers
